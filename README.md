##  Postman / Thunder Client

### Thunder Client (Recommended)
- VS Code → Thunder Client
- Export collection (JSON)
- Add to repo as:
/postman/tasktaker-api.json

“How would scale this for production?”
For production scaling, I would deploy the backend using containerization (Docker) and place it behind a load balancer. Environment variables would be managed via secret managers. MongoDB indexes would be added on frequently queried fields. Caching (Redis) could be introduced for task lists and profile data. API rate limiting and request validation would improve security. CI/CD pipelines would automate testing and deployments. Monitoring and logging would be added using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
